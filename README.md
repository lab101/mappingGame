mappingGame
===========

source code of a interactive mapping game build in Cinder http://www.lab101.be/projects/eristoff-mapping-game.aspx

Code by www.lab101.be & www.neuroproductions.be
3D models by Wes Nijsen (did) 

This game was build by two developers for 4 hour event so it was not our goal to write the most clean code :)
But it's super stable.

Best cloned in a your cinder/your_apps_folder/
